# Basic_Networking
This repository contains projects related to basic networking and simple network setups using Cisco Packet Tracer. Perfect for beginners or anyone looking to reinforce their foundational understanding of networking.
🔌 Basic Network Simulation

This project demonstrates a basic network topology using four end devices, two switches, and one router. It showcases essential networking principles including subnetting, switching, and routing.

🧱 Topology Overview
=
End Devices: 4
Switches: 2
Router: 1

Connection Design:
=
Two end devices are connected to each switch.
Both switches are connected to the router.
This setup allows:
Communication within a subnet through switches.
Communication across subnets via the router.

🔗 Functionality
=
✅ Devices in the same subnet communicate through their respective switch.
✅ Devices in different subnets communicate through the router.
✅ Basic IP addressing and subnetting are configured.
✅ Ping tests validate successful communication both intra- and inter-subnet.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
=
Cisco Packet Tracer (or GNS3, if applicable)
Core networking concepts:
IP Addressing
Subnetting
Switching
Routing
🚀 Getting Started
=
1. Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Verify:
Device connections
IP configurations
Subnet assignments
3. Test network communication using the Ping command:
📶 Within Subnet: Ping between devices on the same switch
🌐 Across Subnets: Ping between devices on different switches via router
